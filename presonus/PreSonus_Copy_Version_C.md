# PreSonus Producer Lab: Marie Vaunt Remix Quest

## Opening Statement
From Kurai Records to your studio, Submix.io and PreSonus invite collaborative teams to dissect, redesign, and unleash Marie Vaunt’s electrifying single "The Chosen." Across five focused weeks, partners will craft their vision together inside the Submix Sessions live collaboration platform while vying for hardware from PreSonus, Fender, Norand, and Embodme.

## Experience Pillars
### Collaboration-First
Harness Submix Sessions to co-create, trade feedback, and document the contributions each collaborator brings—whether it’s sequencing, live synth work, or vocal performances.

### Tech-Forward
Access multi-track stems, vocal chops, FX racks, and Studio One templates drawn directly from "The Chosen." Sync your hardware—from Fender instruments to Norand and Embodme controllers—for hybrid performances that shine in the final render.

### Career-Ready
Winners earn hardware, spotlight coverage on PreSonus and Submix channels, and consideration for future Kurai Records collaborations with Marie Vaunt.
